##  About me
I'm a passionate full-stack engineer with expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript. My tech stack includes Express, Node.js, React, and Next.js.

I've worked on various projects, contributing to both the server and client-side development. Whether it's crafting robust APIs with Node.js and Express or creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces with React and Next.js, I love the challenges that come with being a full-stack developer.
