I'm a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#. My tech stack includes Node.js and ASP.NET Core.

I've worked on various projects, contributing to both the server and client-side development. Whether it's crafting robust APIs with Node.js, Express, or ASP.NET Core, or creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces with React and Next.js.
